Technologies Used: C

Project Description:
-Developed a Unix shell interface in C as part of a university course project, designed to execute user commands and manage processes within a Unix environment.
-Implemented core functionalities including input/output redirection, pipes for inter-process communication, and command execution in child processes using system calls such as fork(), exec(), wait(), dup2(), and pipe().
-Enhanced the shell with custom features like command history retrieval, enabling users to rerun previous commands with '!!', and built-in support for concurrent process execution with '&' operator.
-Integrated file redirection operations, allowing redirection of standard input and output to and from files using the dup2() system call, which facilitated complex command line operations involving multiple utilities.


Key Achievements:
-Successfully simulated advanced shell operations, increasing understanding and practical application of Unix system-level programming.
-Delivered a fully functional shell interface that supports multitasking and batch processing, demonstrating deep integration of Unix system concepts.
-Provided a robust platform for testing and development purposes, exemplified by comprehensive documentation and live demonstration examples included in the project repository.
